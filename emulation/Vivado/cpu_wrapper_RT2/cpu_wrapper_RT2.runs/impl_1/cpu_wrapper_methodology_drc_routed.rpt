TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks dut_clk_pin and emu_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks dut_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks emu_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks emu_clk_pin and dut_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks emu_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks dut_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT _1181_ has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources.
